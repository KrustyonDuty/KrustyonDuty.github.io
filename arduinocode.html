<h2> Video Narration </h2>
  <p>Our Arduino project is a mini piano that makes noise when you press the buttons. It has seven buttons that have their own little noise.
  Connected to the board, the Arduino piano has seven different noises for each button. Having the code implemented into the Arduino board it
  helps the board process the information, and starts the action from the code.</p>

<h3> Written Response </h3>
<p> Having many ideas, to what to do with the arduino board. Coming up with an idea called the "Arduino Piano", this would make a small like piano
    that would give off noise and would have to be implemented physically into the buttons. Our board consisted of seven buttons, a piezo buzzer
    a dozen of wires. To start it off we would have to connect wires to get something going, having many troubles in our little project, we came 
    across a wrong wire that was not in the right spot for the code. Which would then later cause us to take it all apart and start all over. 
    When building it back together we would then add new details too the board. Having taking apart the project, we had a good idea where the right
    wires would go and the code would be fixed later on.</p>
