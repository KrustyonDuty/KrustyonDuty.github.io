<p> My name is Angel Puga and I was born in the Coachella Valley. What I plan to be when I grow up is to become a chef. To start I would go to college to study cullinary or do something related to cooking.
I've I always loved the way people use their own skills to cook, I always practice making meals that would make people smile. I grew up watching my mother make meals for me that would always make my day, and
so I thought to myslef, if I practice cooking and specialize in something, I could cook meals for my mother and bring a smile to her face like she would when I was a kid.</p>
