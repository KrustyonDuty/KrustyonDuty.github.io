  <p> My name is Angel Puga and I was born in the Coachella Valley. What I plan to be when I grow up is to become a chef. To start I would go to college to study cullinary or do something related to cooking.
I've I always loved the way people use their own skills to cook, I always practice making meals that would make people smile. I grew up watching my mother make meals for me that would always make my day, and
so I thought to myslef, if I practice cooking and specialize in something, I could cook meals for my mother and bring a smile to her face like she would when I was a kid.</p>

<p2> Usually I don't compete in things, I just often like to cook for myself and my mom. Im usually cautious of cooking for people, but when im alone I excell in my cooking skills. If they were any cooking classes
in my school I would totally take the class to learn new things. My mom would cook food and sell them, I often help her with the food and tell her what she's missing. Helping my mom would make me improve, she would
often tell me to look for a competition in our valley where I could participate, I do not like the heat of the competition just never liked it, I know in my life im going to have to compete to show off my skills.</p2>

<p3> In conclusion my goal is to graduate high school and go to cullinary school were I could learn new things and become a chef. Thanks for reading me and please explore my page.</p3>
